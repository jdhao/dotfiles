# Introduction

In this directory, I store my dot files for Bash and Zsh.

# Set up

On systems we do not have root priviledge, we have to manually install the
latest version of Zsh and change shell to Zsh after starting bash.

For how to build Zsh from source, see [this
post](https://jdhao.github.io/2018/10/13/centos_zsh_install_use/). Oh-my-zsh
are also required to use some of the plugins.
[zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) also needs to be installed on the
system to manage other plugins.
